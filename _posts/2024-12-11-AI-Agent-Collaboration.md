  * Distributed Problem Solving
  * Negotiation Protocols
  * Resource Allocation

### Collaboration Mechanisms

| Collaboration Type | Description | Complexity | Key Characteristics |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Parallel Processing** | Simultaneous task execution | Low | - Independent task handling - Minimal interdependence - Quick result aggregation |
| **Sequential Collaboration** | Staged problem-solving | Medium | - Handoff between agents - Specialized skill utilization - Staged information transfer |
| **Negotiation-Based** | Dynamic role assignment | High | - Adaptive task allocation - Conflict resolution - Complex decision-making |
| **Emergent Collaboration** | Self-organizing systems | Highest | - Adaptive learning - Contextual intelligence - Autonomous coordination |

### Technical Collaboration Approaches

1. **Communication Protocols**
